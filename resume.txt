PROJECTS

Web3HFT
https://github.com/mrtoronto/web3_hft
Created framework for making and evaluating trading strategies with the freqtrade library
Setup logic to find assets worth watching
Setup pipelines to run grid searches over strategy parameters
Evaluated sets of parameters and deployed best parameters to live trading bot
Consulted with trading experts and tried to distill their knowledge to automate it
Pushed all metrics and logs to spreadsheet for manual inspection (example sheet)
Preceded by a NEAT ETH model where I tried to use a genetic algorithm to generate strategies
The genetic algo was too much and not enough at the same time

Lycan Protocol Developer
https://github.com/mrtoronto/lycan-protocol-contract
https://etherscan.io/address/0xaed8f91df327d9db27e5b5e0f11a0a001c727ce0
Only technical team member for launch of ERC-721A token
Wrote, tested and deployed smart contracts for token
Generated 6,600 unique images by layering sets of 10-100 trait images
Generated and organized metadata associated with trait images for each asset
Setup and executed decentralized payment methods for team

Forms Discord Bot Engineer
https://github.com/mrtoronto/forms-discord-bot
Created Wavey, a GPT-4 powered discord bot with different personalities, commands and modes
Wavey:
Is sarcastic and borderline rude but always hilarious
Created greeting channels and greeted each user that joined with a VIP link
Occasionally went into roast mode for a few hours
Helped server moderators handle normal moderation tasks
Bot was deployed to a digital ocean server and worked using discord.py and OpenAI API’s

NFT Shazam
https://github.com/mrtoronto/nft-shazam
Created a system to let users find relevant NFT metadata from an image or screenshot
System embedded tens of thousands of NFT images using alexnet and stored embeds in a FAISS index
System processed and stored associated metadata for all embedded NFTs
Queries sent to the system were embedded the same way and most similar stored assets were returned

Lyrical Clustering
https://github.com/mrtoronto/lyrical_clustering
Embedded lyrics from some of my favorite artists and plotted them to see who was semantically similar
Used S-BERT model to embed lyrics then used PCA to reduce the embeddings to 2 dimensions
Scraped lyrics from genius and collected images for the plots manually

Podcast Semantic Search
https://github.com/mrtoronto/podcast-semantic-search
Built system to ingest, transcribe and run semantic queries on podcast transcripts
Used Huggingface Wav2Vec model to transcribe text
Tested both TF-IDF and DPR for relevant passage selection
